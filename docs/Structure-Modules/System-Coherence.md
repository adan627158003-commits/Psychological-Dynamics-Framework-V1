System Coherence Layer (Public V1)

Structural-layer summary. Full mechanism not included.

⸻

1. Definition

The system-coherence layer integrates all structural modules into a unified functional identity.
It ensures that:
	•	psychological subsystems do not drift apart
	•	interpretation, behavior, and motivation remain synchronized
	•	the self remains continuous across time and context
	•	activation levels remain energetically balanced

The coherence layer is the “glue” that prevents fragmentation of the self.

2. Functional Characteristics

2.1 Cross-Module Synchronization

Coordinates timing between:
	•	intrinsic drivers
	•	cognitive routing
	•	meaning formation
	•	experiential updating

Prevents “out-of-phase” dynamics (e.g., emotion rising while interpretation collapses).

⸻

2.2 Global Stability Envelope

Maintains a stable operating range:
	•	prevents runaway meaning amplification
	•	prevents emotional depletion
	•	prevents structural overload
	•	keeps self-referential loop within normal thresholds

If the stability envelope collapses, the system enters instability modes (not public in V1).

2.3 Contextual Integration

Aligns identity with environment:
	•	updates relevance maps
	•	adjusts motivational priorities
	•	calibrates certainty gradients
	•	suppresses outdated interpretations

Ensures behavior stays adaptive rather than rigid.

3. Known Failure Patterns (Simplified for V1)

Full technical versions are not included.
Documented public-level failures:
	•	Meaning Over-dominance → rigidity, obsession, narrow interpretation
	•	Experience Under-supply → emotional flattening, detachment
	•	Cognitive Over-routing → analysis paralysis
	•	Driver Instability → impulsivity, oscillating identity
	•	Coherence Drift → fragmented self-states, inconsistent behavior

These patterns are predictable when subsystem synchronization drops.

4. Notes for Researchers & Developers

Full system-coherence algorithms are intentionally not included in this version.
The following remain unpublished:
	•	cross-layer temporal synchronization
	•	recursive coherence-repair mechanisms
	•	identity continuity propagation model
	•	high-resolution instability matrices

These will appear in future technical releases.

This file completes the public structural layer.
The mechanism layer remains intentionally absent in V1.
