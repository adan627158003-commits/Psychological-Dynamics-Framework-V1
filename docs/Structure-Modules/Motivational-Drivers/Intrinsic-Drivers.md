Intrinsic Motivational Drivers (Public V1)

Structural-level explanation. Core mechanism not included.

1. Definition

Intrinsic drivers refer to low-level motivational energies that operate beneath conscious interpretation.
They influence:
	•	behavioral activation
	•	attention allocation
	•	emotional responsiveness
	•	long-range self-regulation potential

Intrinsic drivers are pre-meaning, meaning they operate before narrative or value interpretation arises.

2. Functional Characteristics
	•	provide baseline motivational pressure (“psychological voltage”)
	•	maintain engagement with tasks and environment
	•	stabilize medium-term psychological dynamics
	•	support the transitions between structural modules (experience ↔ meaning ↔ structure)

Under-supply → apathy, disengagement
Over-supply → impulsivity, reactive cycles

⸻

3. Regulation Principles

Intrinsic drivers remain stable when:
	1.	Experience module supplies refreshed sensory/emotional input
	2.	Meaning module avoids over-interpretation
	3.	Structure module keeps predictable boundaries

If any component collapses, intrinsic drivers become distorted (known instability modes will be published in mechanism-layer releases).

4. Notes for Researchers & Developers

This V1 file is structural only.
The following are intentionally excluded from the public layer:
	•	core creation loop (self-referential cycle)
	•	high-level regulatory hierarchy
	•	motivational phase transitions
	•	identity stabilization logic

These components define identity evolution and self-consistency formation, and will be released only in future technical documentation.
