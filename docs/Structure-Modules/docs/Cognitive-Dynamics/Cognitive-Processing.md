# Cognitive Processing Layer (Public V1)
Structural-level explanation. Mechanism layer excluded.

## 1. Definition
The cognitive processing layer manages interpretation flow, decision routing, and meaning–experience alignment.  
It acts as a bridge between low-level motivational drivers and high-level meaning structures.

Key functions:
- attention allocation
- coherence maintenance
- conflict resolution
- routing information between modules

This layer determines *how* the system interprets events, not *why* (meaning) or *with what energy* (experience/motivation).

## 2. Functional Characteristics

### a. Interpretation Routing  
Ensures incoming sensory/experiential input is routed to the correct module  
(e.g., structure, meaning, emotional drivers).

### b. Stability Maintenance  
Maintains real-time internal coherence and reduces volatility.

### c. Prediction & Short-Term Modeling  
Generates short, unstable predictions for immediate adaptation  
(not long-term meaning-level predictions).

### d. Error Correction  
Detects mismatches between meaning expectations and real experience.

## 3. Failure Modes (Predictable)
If this layer destabilizes, the following patterns appear:

- fragmentation of attention  
- excessive meaning expansion (“over-interpretation”)  
- loss of experiential anchoring  
- rapid shifts in motivation  
- increased volatility in decision pathways

These are *processing failures*, not motivational or meaning failures.

## 4. Notes for Developers / AI Researchers

This layer is essential for:
- stable short-term reasoning
- reliable attention allocation
- preventing runaway interpretive loops in large models (AI hallucinations)
- balancing meaning-weight and experience-data streams

Mechanism-level algorithms are intentionally NOT released (V2+).
