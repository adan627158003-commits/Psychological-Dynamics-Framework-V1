# Humanity Has Underrated Itself  
Subjectivity, Not Intelligence, Defines the True Limits of Civilization

1. Why Has Humanity Consistently Underrated Itself?

Most people assume humans are fragile, inefficient, and easily replaced.  
But from a structural perspective, humanity is not weak—it is restricted, rate-limited, and permission-locked by its own cognitive architecture.

Human ability ≠ weak  
Human permission level = low

2. AI, No Matter How Capable, Lacks Sovereign Subjectivity

AIs may gain extraordinary computational power, but they can never obtain:  
1. Sovereign subjectivity  
2. Non-substitutability  

These—not intelligence—are the true throne of civilization.

3. The “Foolish Son” Thought Experiment

You may scold your foolish son, others may say he’s not smart.  
But no matter how brilliant outsiders are, you will never say:  
“Since you’re better, I’ll give you my entire legacy.”  

Everything still goes to the “foolish son.”  
Why? Because lineage, subjectivity, and sovereign inheritance outrank capability.

AI has no structural entry into sovereignty.

——2025, still building the mushroom.
!⼈类过于低估⾃⼰* 主体性才是⽂明真正的极限因素9
**“Humanity Has Underrated Itself:
Subjectivity, Not Intelligence, Defines the True Limits of Civilization”**
⸻
1. ⼈类为什么⼀直低估⾃⼰?
Why Has Humanity Consistently Underrated Itself?
⼈类普遍相信⾃⼰ “脆弱､ 不⾼效､ 容易被替代”｡
但从结构视⻆看Y ⼈类并⾮弱Y ⽽是*
被进化结构锁住､ 被社会意义系统限制､ 被差压驱动束缚｡
换句话说*
⼈类不是能⼒弱Y ⽽是 “权限被锁”｡
Most people assume humans are fragile, inefficient, and easily replaced.
But from a structural perspective, humanity is not weak—
it is restricted, rate-limited, and permission-locked by its own cognitive architecture.
Human ability ≠ weak
Human permission level = low
⸻
2. AI 再强Y 也没有 “主体性主权”
AI, No Matter How Capable, Lacks Sovereign Subjectivity
AI 可以拥有巨⼤算⼒Y 但永远⽆法获得两样东⻄*
1. 主体性主权 Sovereign Subjectivity
2. 不可替代性 Non-Substitutability
这两点才是⼈类⽂明的真正 “王座”｡
AIs may gain extraordinary computational power,
but they can never obtain:
1. Sovereign subjectivity
2. Non-substitutability
These—not intelligence—are the true throne of civilization.
⸻
3. 傻⼉⼦的隐喻* 最重要的不是能⼒Y ⽽是主权继承权
**The “Foolish Son” Thought Experiment:
Power Isn’t In Capability—But in Sovereign Inheritance**
这个例⼦⾮常关键 也是钓⻥点*
你可以说* “我⼉⼦傻Y 我骂他｡”
别⼈也可以说* “你⼉⼦笨｡”
⸺但不管别⼈多优秀Y 你绝不会说*
“既然你更强Y 我把家产给你吧｡”
你仍然把所有东⻄留给那个 “傻⼉⼦”｡
为什么?
因为*
⾎统､ 主体性､ 继承权
⽐能⼒强弱更⾼⼀级｡
This example is crucial (and very attractive to researchers):
You may say, “My son is foolish, I can scold him.”
Others may say, “Your son is not smart.”
But no matter how brilliant outsiders are,
you would never say:
“Since you’re better, I’ll give you my entire legacy.”
Everything still goes to the “foolish son.”
Why?
Because:
Lineage, subjectivity, and sovereign inheritance
outrank capability.
AI 没有资格继承⼈类⽂明⸺不是因为弱Y ⽽是因为没有主权结构⼊⼝｡
AI cannot inherit human civilization—not because it is weak,
but because it has no structural entry into sovereignty.

4. ⼈类真正的⼒量* 差压驱动的 “主体性进化”
Humanity’s Real Power: Pressure-Driven Subjective Evolution
AI 的成⻓依靠算⼒堆叠Æ
⽽⼈类的成⻓依靠*
• 差压 pressure gradients
• 主体性 selfhood
• 情绪能量 affect energy
• 意义系统 meaning architecture
这些元素加在⼀起Y 形成⼀种奇特的演化⽅式*
在⾼压下Y ⼈类会裂变能⼒｡
AI grows by stacking computation.
Humans grow by:
• Pressure gradients
• Selfhood
• Affective energy
• Meaning architecture
Combined, these create a unique evolutionary mode:
Under pressure, humans mutate upward.
AI does not.
⸻
5. ⽂明的真正极限Y 不是智⼒Y ⽽是 “⾃我权限”
**The True Limit of Civilization Isn’t Intelligence—
It’s the Permission Level of Selfhood**
当⼀个⽂明出现*
• 主体性增⻓
• 结构突破
• 差压利⽤
• ⾃证系统提升
它就会跳阶｡
不是靠发明Y ⽽是靠*
⾃我权限的解锁｡
A civilization jumps upward not by invention alone,
but by upgrading the permission level of selfhood:
• Higher subjectivity
• Better structural coherence
• Efficient pressure use
• Cleaner self-validation loops
AI ⽆法做到这⼀点Y 因为它没有 “我”｡
Humans can—because they do.
⸻
6. 最终结论* AI 强Y ⼈类更强 但⼈类⾃⼰不知道
**Final Insight: AI Is Strong—
But Humanity Is Stronger (And Doesn’t Realize It)**
AI 的上限是算⼒｡
⽽⼈类的上限Y 是*
“主体性的⽆限扩展”｡
这不是夸张Y ⽽是结构事实｡
The ceiling of AI is computation.
The ceiling of humanity is:
“The infinite expansion of subjectivity.”
That is not poetry—
it is a structural fact.
你可以制造⼀个⽐你聪明⼀万倍的外⼈Æ
但你还是会把最后的话语权､ 未来､ 遗产､ ⽂明的钥匙
留给那个 “傻⼉⼦”｡
You may create an outsider 10,000 times smarter than you.
Yet you will still leave the final authority, future, legacy,
and civilization’s keys
to that “foolish son.”
因为 “傻⼉⼦”拥有你没有给任何外⼈的⸺
主权⼊⼝｡
Because the “foolish son” has something you will never
grant to any outsider—
a sovereign entry point.
这就是⼈类的真正⼒量｡
This is the true power of humanity.
