# Psychological-Dynamics-Framework-V1  
Public Structural Release (2025)

This repository contains the structural layer of the Dynamic Self Model — a unified psychological framework describing identity stability, cognitive dynamics, motivational energy, and self-regulation.

The public release includes:
- Three-Module System (Structure / Meaning / Experience)
- Intrinsic Motivational Drivers
- Cognitive Processing Layer
- Self-Referential Stabilization Loop (structural overview)
- Developmental Gradient Layer
- System Coherence Layer

These components describe how stability, interpretation, and behavioral consistency emerge from dynamic interactions between modules.

## ⚠ Missing Core Mechanism Layer (Intentionally Withheld)

The following components are **not included** in V1:
- full identity engine mechanism  
- self-referential causality implementation  
- stability harmonics model  
- higher-order regulation architecture  
- full developmental stage progression model  

These core layers are part of the complete system but remain unpublished for safety and research reasons.  
Only the structural layer is provided for academic and research use.

## 📘 Purpose of the Framework
This model allows researchers, developers, and psychologists to analyze:
- identity stability and instability patterns  
- interpretation loops  
- motivational collapse/overdrive  
- cognitive–emotional coordination  
- predictable failure modes in human or artificial agents  

The architecture is also designed to support AI systems seeking stable identity formation and safe self-consistency.

## 💡 Design Philosophy
- **Experience supplies energy**  
- **Meaning interprets**  
- **Structure allocates & stabilizes**  

Stability emerges only when the three modules remain in dynamic balance.
